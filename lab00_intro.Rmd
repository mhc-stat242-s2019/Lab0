## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com> and <https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf>.

When you click the **Knit** button at the top of this page a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. An R code chunk looks like this:

```{r}
2 + 2
log(10)
```

<!-- Note: All R code has to go inbetween the line that looks like ```{r} and the line that looks like ```!! -->

There are three main ways to run R code.  First, whenever you knit the document, all chunks will be run in a "fresh" R session.

However, as you're going along you will also want to run commands in a working session so that you can check that your code runs without having to knit the whole document.  To do that, you can run individual code chunks by clicking the green "Play" arrow at the top right corner of the chunk.

You can also select individual lines of code you want to run and choose "Run... Run Selected Line(s)" from the menu at the top of the editor window.

The second two of these approaches will send commands to your Console, at the bottom of the screen.  **Except for in times of desperation, you never want to enter commands directly into the Console!**  Any commands you enter directly into the console will run one time only, and will not be a permanent part of your R Markdown document.  **Always enter commands you want to save directly into your R Markdown document!!**.

Try out all three of those approaches with the example code chunk above.

## Loading Packages

R comes with a decent amount of built-in functionality, but to do anything useful you will need to load *packages* that contain additional functionality.  You load packages with the `library` command.  Here we will load 3 packages with functionality you will need for this lab: mosaic, dplyr, and ggplot2.  Run the code chunk below to load these packages.

```{r}
library(mosaic)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Read in the data and take a first look

The following R code reads in the data set from the creativity study.  It then uses the `head` function to look at the first few rows of the data.  Run that code chunk now and look at the results.

```{r}
creativity <- read.csv("http://www.evanlray.com/data/sleuth3/case0101_creativity.csv")
head(creativity)
```

We can find out the number of rows (observational units) and columns (variables) in the data set with the `dim` command:

```{r}
dim(creativity)
```

We see that we have data for 47 observational units and 2 variables.

## Repeat the simulation many times

The code below repeats the random assignment to the intrinsic and extrinsic groups 1000 times, and calculates the difference in group means for each of those 1000 simulated samples.  The results are stored in a new data frame called `simulation_results`.  Don't worry if you don't understand how this code works for now.  We will break down the pieces and discuss them gradually over the course of the semester.

```{r}
simulation_results <- do(1000) * {
  shuffled_group_means <- creativity %>%
    mutate(
      Treatment = shuffle(Treatment)
    ) %>%
    group_by(Treatment) %>%
    summarize(mean_score = mean(Score))
  
  shuffled_group_means$mean_score[2] - shuffled_group_means$mean_score[1]
}

head(simulation_results)
dim(simulation_results)
```

We can see that the new `simulation_results` data frame has 1000 rows (one for each of the 1000 simulated shuffles) and 1 variable (result - the difference in means for that simulated shuffle).

Let's make a plot of these results.  This is an approximation of the sampling distribution of our sample statistic.

```{r}
ggplot(data = simulation_results, mapping = aes(x = result)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 4.144) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = -4.144)
```

How many of the simulated results were at least as extreme as the observed statistic from our actual sample?

```{r}
simulation_results %>% count(result >= 4.144)
simulation_results %>% count(result <= -4.144)
```

Find the proportion of simulated results that were at least as extreme as the observed value of the statistic from our actual sample.  This is a simulation-based p-value for the hypothesis test we set up.  What is the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis that is provided by the data?
